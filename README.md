# Qlik-Airline-Analysis
The goal of the Airline Analysis Dashboard project is to improve airline management's data-driven decision-making by developing an engaging and interactive dashboard with Qlik Sense. A thorough dataset of flight information, including numbers, timings, airports, delays, cancellations, and passenger counts, must be gathered and prepared for the project. Heat maps for flight density, pie charts for flight status distribution, bar charts for flight counts, line charts for delay trends, and geo-maps for route visualization will all be included in the dashboard's visuals. Metrics like average delays and cancellation rates will be highlighted via key performance indicators (KPIs). To guarantee that the dashboard efficiently supports operational efficiency and increased customer satisfaction, the project includes user-friendly interactions, extensive testing, and user training.
